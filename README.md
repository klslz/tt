Touch Toolbox (no longer maintained)

This is the repo for the Touch Toolbox.

The Touch Toolbox is a tuning/optimization toolset for the 
Linux based Logitech Squeezebox Touch audio streamer.
It's about ten years that the device is out of production.

I still (2023) receive mails asking for the TouchToolbox.

I now decided to put it on github. I can neither support 
anybody nor I am able to maintain the toolbox. I simply do 
not have a working Squeezebox Touch at hand anymore.
You'll be 100% on your own, if you use/apply it. 

I'll add the setup documentation I had on my blog in the past.
And you'll find the TouchToolbox 3.0. 3.0 was the last version 
I released back than. 

You might have noticed I put it under GPL3 license.

Enjoy.
